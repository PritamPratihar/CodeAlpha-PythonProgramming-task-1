# Hangman – Python (Tkinter)

A simple **Hangman** game made with **Python** and **Tkinter**.

## What this project is

This project is a GUI version of the classic Hangman word guessing game. It provides an onscreen keyboard, attempt counter, and messages for wins/losses.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8 or newer
* `tkinter` (comes with standard Python on most systems)

## Files

* `hangman.py` — main Python file containing the game (your code).
* `README.md` — this file.

> Tip: Put your code file name as `hangman.py` (or keep your current name). Keep both files in one folder.

## How to run (locally)

1. Open a terminal / command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run:

```bash
python hangman.py
```

If your system uses `python3`, use `python3 hangman.py`.

## How to put this code on GitHub (step-by-step)

1. Create a new folder locally and copy your `hangman.py` and this `README.md` into it.
2. Open terminal and go to that folder.
3. Run these commands (replace `<repo-name>` and `<your-github-url>`):

```bash
# initialize git
git init

# add files
git add .

# commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Hangman Tkinter game"

# create a repo on GitHub (use the website) and copy the repo URL, then:
# example: git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/<repo-name>.git

git remote add origin <your-github-url>

# push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Useful `.gitignore` (optional)

Create a file named `.gitignore` with these lines:

```
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
.vscode/
```

## Improvements you can add

* Load word list from a file (for more words).
* Show a graphical hangman image stepping with wrong guesses.
* Add difficulty levels.
* Save high scores.

## License

You can use and change this code freely.

---

If you want, I can also:

* Create a `.gitignore` file for you.
* Prepare the Git commands filled with your repo URL.
* Make a short `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `LICENSE` file.

Tell me which one to make next.
